# Cloud Native App Demo

A full stack cloud native app demo.  Developed for the Fast Feedback session of [Civo's Devops Bootcamp](https://www.civo.com/blog/devops-bootcamp-2021).  This is a hard fork of [Google's Microservice Demo](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo), but modified to build out and run easily on multiple providers.

## Prerequisites

- A Civo account
- The following installed locally
  - A public Docker Repository ([Docker.IO](https://www.docker.com/),([Quay](https://quay.io/), etc)
  - Docker
  - Make
  - [kubeclt](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
  - [skaffold](https://skaffold.dev/docs/install/)

## Setup

- Copy `Makefile.env.sample` to `Makefile.env`, add your Civo CLI key
- Update the `BUILD_REPO` in  `Makefile` to point to your personal repository
- Run `make k3s-list` to verify your local environment is setup and the Civo key provided works

</p>

**Online Boutique** is a cloud-native microservices demo application.
Online Boutique consists of a 10-tier microservices application. The application is a
web-based e-commerce app where users can browse items,
add them to the cart, and purchase them.

## Quickstart (Civo)


1. **Clone this repository.**

```
git clone https://github.com/ssmiller25/cloudnativeapp.git
cd cloudnativeapp
```

2. **Provision the Prod and Dev Civo Clusters to demo fast feedback taks.**

```sh
make civo-up
```

3. **Deploy a dev instance - environment with for just your user**

```sh
make dev
```

or to override the username

```sh
USERNAME=smiller make dev
```

4. **Wait for the Pods to be ready.  Namespace will be cnapp-<yourusername>**

```sh
kubectl get pods -n cnapp-smiller
```

After a few minutes, you should see:

```

```

5. **Port Forward to the frontend**

```sh
kubectl port-forward -n cnapp-smiller svc/frontend 8080:80
```

6. **Browse to <http://localhost:8080> and shoudl see the frontend of the app**

## Pipeline Tests

This procedures are normally run from a CI/CD pipeline, but can be tested manually

1. **Deploy a dev instance triggered by PR - will include ingress**



```sh
PR=1234 make pr
```

2. **Determine the rontend IP address of the development cluster** using the frontend's `EXTERNAL_IP`.

```sh
kubectl get ingress frontend -n cnapp-pr-1234 -o jsonpath="{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}{\"\n\"}"
```

3. **Browse to the PR developemnt instance**

http://<ip address>/

4. **Deploy the production instance - will also include ingress**

```sh
make prod
```

2. **Determine the rontend IP address of the production cluster** using the frontend's `EXTERNAL_IP`.

```sh
kubectl get ingress frontend -n cnapp-prod -o jsonpath="{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}{\"\n\"}"
```

3. **Browse to the PR developemnt instance**

http://<ip address>/

## Teardown

Teardown **BOTH** prod and dev environments


```sh
make civo-down
```

## Other Deployment Options

- **Workload Identity**: [See these instructions.](docs/workload-identity.md)
- **Istio**: [See these instructions.](docs/service-mesh.md)
- **Anthos Service Mesh**: ASM requires Workload Identity to be enabled in your GKE cluster. [See the workload identity instructions](docs/workload-identity.md) to configure and deploy the app. Then, use the [service mesh guide](/docs/service-mesh.md).
- **non-GKE clusters (Minikube, Kind)**: see the [Development Guide](/docs/development-guide.md)
- **Memorystore**: [See these instructions](/docs/memorystore.md) to replace the in-cluster `redis` database with hosted Google Cloud Memorystore (redis).


## Architecture

**Online Boutique** is composed of 11 microservices written in different
languages that talk to each other over gRPC. See the [Development Principles](/docs/development-principles.md) doc for more information.

## Features

- **[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io)/[GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/):**
  The app is designed to run on Kubernetes (both locally on "Docker for
  Desktop", as well as on the cloud with GKE).
- **[gRPC](https://grpc.io):** Microservices use a high volume of gRPC calls to
  communicate to each other.
- **[Istio](https://istio.io):** Application works on Istio service mesh.
- **[OpenCensus](https://opencensus.io/) Tracing:** Most services are
  instrumented using OpenCensus trace interceptors for gRPC/HTTP.
- **[Cloud Operations (Stackdriver)](https://cloud.google.com/products/operations):** Many services
  are instrumented with **Profiling**, **Tracing** and **Debugging**. In
  addition to these, using Istio enables features like Request/Response
  **Metrics** and **Context Graph** out of the box. When it is running out of
  Google Cloud, this code path remains inactive.
- **[Skaffold](https://skaffold.dev):** Application
  is deployed to Kubernetes with a single command using Skaffold.
- **Synthetic Load Generation:** The application demo comes with a background
  job that creates realistic usage patterns on the website using
  [Locust](https://locust.io/) load generator.
